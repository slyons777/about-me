    <h1>Hello Everyone, I'm Sarina!</h1>
    <img src="images/data-pic.png" alt="My test image">
    <p> Super excited to be starting here with <a href="https://www.digitalcrafts.com">Digital Crafts</a>. I currently live in Virginia Beach, VA ,but I am originally from California. 
        
        Served some time in the Navy and am now just enjoying pursing my education and looking to become a full-time developer. <br><br>
        
        Top 3 Current Activities/Interests:
        <ul> 
            <li>Attending <a href="https://www.digitalcrafts.com">Digital Crafts</a></li>
            <li>Attending SNHU (Computer Science - Software Engineering</li>
            <li>Looking for a furry friend to adopt!</li>
          </ul><br>
    <p>As someone who is creative by nature (graphic design, filmmaking, photography) I’ve found a really neat sweet spot between combining my love for the arts and my love/obsession with technology!  
      
    The tech industry continually shapes our entire lives by the way we are able to experience the world around us.<br><br>Personally I find it fascinating; the limitless options an individual or a company 
    
    can explore when it comes to creating software, apps, websites, etc. What’s even better is being able come together with teams of people who have an equal desire to put their creativity into full 
    
    force in such a way that could impact the world.<br><br>
    </p>

    <h2>Cheers to Day 1!</h2>
